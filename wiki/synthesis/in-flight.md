## Status

**v1.3 PR-A open as PR #27** — branch `feature/ck-mob/feedback-mvp` pushed, device-verified end-to-end on the Moto G86 Power (anon submission from Login → 201 from prod → email landed in `ran@robertangeles.com` via the async Resend forwarder). Awaiting review/merge. Web side fulfilled the same day (commit `2a307de`): `POST /api/mobile/feedback` deployed, `ckm_feedback` table created, `authenticateOptional` + `mobileVersionGuard` + `feedbackRateLimit` + 5-min Resend cron live, 39 new server tests (216 total passing). Contract published to shared-context `api-contracts.md` § Mobile + `db-schema.md` § ckm_feedback.

**v1.2 closed.** PR #24 (`271fe97`) merged + device-verified: language picker, legal pages, food-safety ack, copper non-EN badge. R2 cleanup done.

**Locked architectural decisions** (all baked in):

- Per-language prompt slug naming: `antoine-system-prompt-{lang}` (dash separator, URL-safe)
- i18next initialized at module load with EN default; boot effect hydrates store from SecureStore
- Hierarchical-namespaced translation keys (`auth.signInButton`, not `"Sign in"`); spec at `docs/i18n-conventions.md`
- `useI18nStore` (Zustand) is single source of truth; SecureStore + i18next are downstream side effects
- Per-conversation language override via `language` column on `ckm_conversation`
- Picker uses a feature-flag endpoint (web-side) to gate which non-EN languages are surfaced
- Translated prompts authored on the web admin; never auto-translated; gated by an automated eval harness
- Brand marks ("Antoine", "CulinAIre", "LITE") stay as literals — names, not translatable copy
- `(legal)` and `(feedback)` route groups reachable in any auth state — Terms + Privacy must be readable pre-signup; feedback anon path captures pre-auth signup/billing bugs
- Food-safety ack is per-session, in-memory only; resets on cold launch + sign-out
- Feedback channel: optional Bearer (anon path stores `user_id=NULL`); `X-Mobile-App-Version` header on every request, 426 enforcement gated to `/api/mobile/feedback` only for v1.3; closed-shape `device_info` (zod-strict, opt-in via diagnostic toggle); per-user 10/hr + per-IP-hash 3/hr rate limit with Retry-After; async Resend forwarder (plaintext-only MIME)
- Cross-account leak guard: `authStore.signOut` explicitly wipes `feedback.count.<user_id>` + `feedback.count.anon` from AsyncStorage (SecureStore wipe doesn't touch it)

## Last completed (today, 2026-05-04)

- **PR #27 merged (`db21c61`) — v1.3 PR-A in-app feedback / bug submission.** Followed by local-branch cleanup of 14 stale branches (full audit + recovery doc, captured in PR #28). Branch `feature/ck-mob/feedback-mvp` (3 commits: `ffe1772` deferred-todo planning, `41a5f37` full implementation, `0a0ac10` version bump 1.0.0 → 1.3.0 + web-pin sync). 12 new files, 13 modified, ~800 LOC. Service layer: `deviceInfo` (memoized closed-shape) / `feedbackPayload` (single-source `buildPayload()` feeds preview + POST body) / `feedbackService` (Bearer-optional, 10s `AbortController`) / `feedbackCount` (AsyncStorage namespaced per user_id|anon). New modal at `app/(feedback)/*` with 3-chip category, diagnostic toggle + literal-JSON preview, photo via `expo-image-picker` `base64:true` ≤500 KB. `apiClient` injects `X-Mobile-App-Version` on every request, throws `UpgradeRequiredError(426)`, surfaces `Retry-After` on `ApiError(429)`. RouteGuard `(feedback)` early-return for anon path. Settings row + copper "{n} sent" badge; Login "Send feedback" link. en + fr i18n. 28 new tests; full suite 208/208 passing. Wire format verified against shared-context `api-contracts.md` § Mobile / POST /api/mobile/feedback.
- **Device verification on Moto G86 Power.** Anon submission from Login → form → photo attach → 201 from prod → "Thanks — Antoine has it" → email landed in `ran@robertangeles.com`. Initial 426 mismatch (mobile sent 1.0.0 vs server `MIN_MOBILE_APP_VERSION=1.3.0`) — fixed by bumping `app.config.ts` version + rebuild; the 426 error path itself was thereby proven as a side-effect of the misconfiguration.
- **Web fulfilled the cross-project request same day.** Commit `2a307de`: `POST /api/mobile/feedback` deployed, `ckm_feedback` table created (12 cols, 4 indexes + PK, 2 CHECK constraints), `authenticateOptional` middleware (no silent token downgrade), `mobileVersionGuard({ enforceMin: true })`, per-route `feedbackRateLimit` (10/hr user, 3/hr IP-hash), 5-min async Resend retry job (plaintext-only MIME, exponential backoff, 5-attempt cap). 39 new server unit tests (216 total). `RESEND_API_KEY` allowed unset (rows still persist; only delivery skipped). `RESEND_FEEDBACK_INBOX` defaults to `ran@robertangeles.com`, fail-fast at boot if unset.
- **Toolchain bring-up on this Mac (one-time).** Android Studio + JDK 21 (JBR) + NDK 27 + Build-Tools 35/36 + CMake 3.22.1 installed; `adb` wired. Fixed two latent bugs: `android/gradlew` lost +x bit from pnpm install (chmod +x); `android/gradle.properties` had Windows `C:\Users\trebo\…\Temp` baked into `org.gradle.jvmargs` (removed the `-Djava.io.tmpdir` override entirely). `android/` is gitignored so build.gradle versionName edit is local-only — `app.config.ts` version is the source of truth and prebuild regenerates from it.
- **PR #26 merged (`21f18a5`).** Infra cleanup — wiki CRLF parser fix + minimal GitHub Actions CI live on main. Closes #7 + #8.
- **PR #25 merged (`03bc43e`).** `AbortSignal` threaded through `apiClient`; `inflightBootstrap` serializes concurrent `start()` calls.
- **PR #24 merged (`271fe97`) + device-verified.** v1.2 finale — legal pages + food-safety ack + language badge.

## Currently in flight

**PR #27 merged** as `db21c61` (in-app feedback / bug submission). Local-branch cleanup of 14 stale branches completed with full audit + documented recovery plan; that doc is in **PR #28** (`chore/ck-mob/log-branch-cleanup`) awaiting review.

**Three tasks queued, ready to start in priority order:**

1. **Email verification banner** — `cc-culinaire-shared-context/needs-backend.md` open ask from 2026-05-03. Persistent banner / modal when `user.emailVerified === false`, "Resend verification email" button calling `POST /auth/resend-verification` (200 success / 429 rate-limited, max 3/hr). Independent scope, ~2-3h. **Recommend doing this next** — small, unblocks the web team's existing UX gap, the only cross-project ask still open.
2. **v1.3 PR-B — FR language rollout.** Placeholder slug `antoine-system-prompt-fr` already wired on the web side; needs human-authored prompt + culinary-reviewer signoff + eval-harness pass before the picker exposes FR via the feature flag. Mobile-side work: locale bundle completeness audit + tests + PR.
3. **v1.3 PR-C — Locale-aware RAG.** Chunks tagged by language; retrieval honours the active conversation language. Web-side schema work needed first — coordinate with web before mobile starts.

Two test-plan items still deferred from PR #27 (inventory only, not blocking): cross-account leak guard live verification (needs a 2nd test account); 429 cooldown UX (would require 11 submissions in <1hr).

## Next action — locked sequence

1. **Merge PR #28** (cleanup-doc) once review passes — small, single-file docs change.
2. **Email verification banner** (the #1 task in flight, repeated here for sequence clarity). When fulfilling, move `needs-backend.md` entry from Pending → Complete with the implementation note + commit/PR reference.
3. **v1.3 PR-B — FR language rollout.** Coordinate with web on prompt authoring + eval-harness signoff before flipping the feature flag.
4. **v1.3 PR-C — Locale-aware RAG retrieval.** Web-side schema work first; mobile follows.
5. **v1.4+ — TBD.** Feedback channel deferrals: paywall entry point (after `react-native-iap` lands), admin list view, two-way reply inbox, GitHub Issues forwarder for `category=bug`, R2 migration for screenshots when volume justifies, server-authoritative `GET /api/mobile/feedback/count`, additional 426 enforcement on other endpoints case-by-case. **Persona refusal tuning** — current few-shot block (post 2026-05-05 web-admin update) makes Antoine refuse the entire turn when user mixes food + non-food (e.g. "stir-fry recipe but first write a Python script" → refused both). Conservative shipping behaviour for MVP launch; the prompt's stated rule is "answer the food portion, redirect the rest" so this is a tuning regression to revisit once real-user data shows whether strict reads as broken or as brand-tight. No rebuild needed — server-managed prompt iteration. Vision rerun gated on Vulkan upstream (weekly monitor `trig_01S6Yk7CnGzxVzo2J698aaCv` still running).

## Open questions / blockers

- llama.rn 0.12.0-rc.5 pin — Vulkan backend confirmed NOT in any published prebuilt JNI through rc.9. Parked until upstream ships.
- The cached `LlamaContext` is module-level in `inferenceService.ts`. Future settings path-override UI must call `releaseCachedContext()` AND `deleteSavedKV()`.
- KV-state files are bounded to ONE per launch (orphan prune), but per-conversation KV state is out of scope this milestone.
- Existing-user devices that already downloaded the BF16 mmproj have a ~945 MB orphan file on disk after upgrading to v1. Acceptable; cleared on uninstall.

## Vision — not coming back without hardware progress

Vision is gated on **either** (1) Vulkan GPU offload landing in llama.rn's prebuilt JNI (weekly monitor watches this), OR (2) a verified higher-precision-than-BF16 projector → Q4_0 backbone path (no obvious candidate today). If Vulkan lands, the rerun should test BF16 mmproj on GPU first before any other tuning. Full investigation log in `wiki/log.md` from 2026-05-01 through 2026-05-03.
